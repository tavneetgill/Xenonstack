# Xenonstack

This repository contains the source code for my website and custom linux script. Please read the instructions below to get started.

## Grocery-Website Branch

The website is hosted in a separate branch named `tav`. To access the website source code and related files, switch to the `tav` branch using the following command:

```bash
git checkout tav
```

## Linux Command Script
In the main branch, you will find a Linux command script (script.sh) that automates certain tasks related to our project. The script is designed to be run on a Linux environment.

# Running the Script
Navigate to the root directory of the repository.

Ensure that the script has execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

Run the script:
./script.sh

## Screenshots
I have included screenshots of the script in action. You can find them in the screenshots directory within the main branch.
